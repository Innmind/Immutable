# Getting Started

This project brings a set of immutable data structure to bring a uniformity on how to handle data.

## Installation

```sh
composer require innmind/immutable
```

## Usage

This library provides the 5 following structures:

- • [`Sequence`](sequence.html)
- • [`Set`](set.html)
- • [`Map`](map.html)
- • [`Str`](str.html)
- • [`RegExp`](regexp.html)

See the documentation for each structure to understand how to use them.

`Sequence`, `Set` and `Map` will ask to provide the types of the elements they contains, you can see [here](types.html) which types you can use.
